# Troubleshooting & FAQ

Run through these quick checks first; they solve most issues. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Common issues & quick fixes

### EA shows “offline” or Snapshot not updating
- Auto Trading is disabled in MT5. Toggle the green **Auto Trading** button.
- WebRequest is not allowed. Add **https://api.pipvaro.com** under **Tools → Options → Expert Advisors** and enable the checkbox.
- EA not attached or attached to the wrong chart. Re-attach the EA to the correct symbol/timeframe.
- Wrong IDs. Double-check **License Key / License ID** and **Receiver ID**.
- Firewall or antivirus blocking connections. Whitelist MT5 and allow the EA’s network access.

### Nothing happens (no trades)
- Market is closed or the symbol is not supported on your plan.
- Risk or position limits are reached (for example max open trades).
- Outdated EA build. Download the latest EA and restart MT5.

### “Invalid license” or “Not authorized”
- License key has extra spaces or characters — paste it exactly.
- License is not assigned to this **Receiver** in the Dashboard.
- Plan inactive or expired — check billing.

### EA missing or cannot load from Experts
- Files copied to the wrong terminal (multiple MT5 installs).
- Copy the EA to **MQL5/Experts/** and **restart** MT5.
- Check the **Experts** and **Journal** tabs for specific errors.

### Wrong platform
- Pipvaro supports **MT5**. MT4 or other platforms will not work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which platforms and brokers are supported?
Pipvaro runs on **MT5** and works with brokers that support MT5 via the Receiver app.

### Do I need my own VPS?
Plans that include hosting run 24/7 on a managed Windows VPS (RDP access). If your plan does not include hosting, run the receiver on your own PC or VPS.

### Can I use this for prop-firm accounts?
Yes. Built-in risk controls (daily/max drawdown, position caps, time/news filters) help you stay within common rules.

### Can I start on demo or free?
Yes. You can start on a free tier to test, then upgrade anytime for more markets and higher frequency.

### How many markets are on each plan?
- **Fusion:** XAUUSD  
- **Lunar:** FX majors and metals  
- **Nova:** FX, metals, and indices

### Can I pause the bot or manage trades manually?
Yes. You can pause/resume per receiver in one click, and you can still manage or close trades directly in MT5.

### How does risk management work?
You configure daily/max drawdown, per-symbol and global position caps, SL/TP modes, breakeven and optional trailing. The EA enforces your settings.

### Is my data and access secure?
Broker credentials stay on your **Receiver**. Config and logs are stored securely and traffic is encrypted. You can revoke a receiver at any time.

### How do billing and cancellations work?
Subscriptions are monthly. You can change or cancel plans anytime; taxes may apply based on your region.
