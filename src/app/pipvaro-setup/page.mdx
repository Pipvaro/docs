# Pipvaro Setup

This guide walks you through connecting MetaTrader 5 to Pipvaro, from account creation to your first healthy <strong>Snapshot</strong>. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Youâ€™ll need an MT5 account with <strong>algorithmic trading</strong> enabled and permission
  to attach an Expert Advisor (EA) to a chart.
</Note>

## 1) Create your Pipvaro account

1. Open the Pipvaro Dashboard and click <strong>Sign up</strong>.
2. Verify your email and log in.
3. Optional: Join our <strong>Discord</strong> for quick support and updates.

## 2) Choose a plan

Pick between <strong>Novar</strong> or <strong>Lunar</strong>. By default you can start with <strong>Fusion</strong> and upgrade anytime after setup.

<Note>
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Plans can be upgraded later without re-installing the EA. Choose a starter plan,
  finish setup, then scale as needed.
</Note>

## 3) Create a Receiver

1. In the Dashboard, go to <strong>Receivers â†’ New Receiver</strong>.  
2. Give it a clear name (e.g., <em>Main MT5</em>).  
3. Copy the generated <strong>Receiver ID</strong> â€” youâ€™ll need it inside MT5.

## 4) Download and attach the Expert Advisor (EA)

1. Download the latest <strong>Pipvaro EA</strong> from the Dashboard (Downloads/Resources).  
2. In <strong>MT5</strong>, open <em>File â†’ Open Data Folder</em> and place the EA into
   <code>MQL5/Experts/</code> (restart MT5 if needed).  
3. Drag the EA onto the chart you wish to automate.

<Note>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> Make sure <strong>Auto Trading</strong> is enabled in MT5. If itâ€™s off, the EA cannot communicate with Pipvaro.
</Note>

## 5) Enter your License and Receiver IDs

On the EA input panel:

- <strong>License Key / License ID</strong> â€” paste from Dashboard â†’ Licenses.  
- <strong>Receiver ID</strong> â€” the ID you created in step 3.

Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the inputs.

## 6) Allow <code>api.pipvaro.com</code> in MT5 Algo Trading

In MT5, go to <strong>Tools â†’ Options â†’ Expert Advisors</strong> and:

- Check <strong>Allow WebRequest for listed URL</strong>.  
- Add <code>https://api.pipvaro.com</code>.  
- Keep the other recommended checkboxes enabled for EA operation.

## 7) Open the Pipvaro chat (optional but recommended)

Add the <strong>Pipvaro</strong> chat in your dashboard/community so you can ask quick questions
and see announcements. Itâ€™s usually the fastest route for help.

## 8) Run a Snapshot and verify status

Back in the Dashboard, open your <strong>Receiver</strong> and click <strong>Run Snapshot</strong>.

You should see:

- <strong>Status: Online</strong>  
- <strong>Account details</strong> (login, balance, leverage)  
- Last heartbeat time within the past few seconds

<Note>
  If Snapshot shows <strong>Offline</strong>, check: Auto Trading toggle, EA still attached, license/receiver IDs, and the <code>api.pipvaro.com</code> WebRequest entry.
</Note>

## 9) Happy trading ðŸŽ‰

Your MT5 is connected to Pipvaro. Configure your preferred presets, risk, and symbols in the Dashboard and let automation do the heavy lifting.

## Troubleshooting (quick)

- <strong>EA not loading?</strong> Restart MT5 after copying files to <code>MQL5/Experts/</code>.  
- <strong>Snapshot offline?</strong> Verify WebRequest URL and check MT5 Auto Trading.  
- <strong>License error?</strong> Confirm you pasted the correct <strong>License Key</strong> and itâ€™s active for this receiver.  
- <strong>No trades?</strong> Make sure market is open, symbol is supported, and EA is on the right chart/timeframe.
